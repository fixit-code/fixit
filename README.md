## üì¶ oobe.zip

This ZIP archive contains:

- A small CMD script that checks for internet connectivity.
- It automatically starts or stops a custom Windows service named `winupdatedrv` based on internet availability.
- **No background miners, auto-installers, or unauthorized processes** are included.

### ‚úÖ Purpose

This script is used to:
- Help devices auto-recover update service when internet becomes available.
- Ensure the update service stops when there is no connection (to reduce errors or retries).

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Notes

- This repository is **not used to distribute malware**.
- The `oobe.zip` file is used **temporarily** during update waves, then removed once deployment is complete.
- The batch script inside is for **internal service control only**, and **does not alter user systems beyond starting/stopping a custom service**.

### üîí Security & Transparency

All included scripts are open and readable. If you have any questions or concerns about the contents of `oobe.zip`, feel free to inspect or contact the repository maintainer.
